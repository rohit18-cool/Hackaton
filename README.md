# Hackaton. This is my project. I tried making a website where people can people can post educational videos, so people can watch and learn from them. The theme is distance. This fits into the topic because this shows distance learning. It will help people who don't understand a concept, etc. I learned a lot of flask while doing this project. This is also my first time doing web development.
